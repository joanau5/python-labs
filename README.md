# Python Labs

- Lab 1 is a simple calculater allowing for +, -, and * operations.
- Lab 2 expands on previous calculator and includes division.
- Lab 3 creates a directory 1/12 (if it doesn't exist), then creates an empty file pynote.txt inside it, and finally prints the file's name and extension.
- Lab 4 builds a nested tree structure with labeled nodes, places an "acorn" at a random node, and then recursively finds and prints the acorn's location.
- Lab 5 saves user inputted notes to a text file, displays them on launch, and allows deleting specific notes by number through a text-based menu.
- Lab 6 lets users save, view, and delete notes stored in a text file, using helper functions to manage file creation, reading, and error handling with pathlib.
- Lab 7 shows how my_var changes across local, enclosed, and global scopes using nested functions and scope inspection.
- Lab 8 defines a simple Note class and provides a command-line interface to view, add, and delete notes stored in a text file.
- Lab 9 extends a note-taking system into a bookmark manager that allows users to add, view, search, open, and delete URLs saved in a file, with basic validation and a command-line menu.
- Lab 14 simulates a virtual dog feeding system by allowing users to create a dog of a given breed, name, and age, then periodically check and respond to the dogâ€™s hunger status through an interactive loop.
